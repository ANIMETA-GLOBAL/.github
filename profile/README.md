###### Welcome to ANIMETA! Here you will find everything you need to know about ANIMETA!!
# Introduction
## vision
#### Aims to help more creators launch their NFTs on the blockchain with the cheapest price in a fair way.
###### ANIMETA is a comprehensive NFT service platform that provides users with high liquidity. It has three major functions: NFT MINT, NFT AIRDROP, NFT BLIND BOX. Users can freely create and trade NFTs, and can enjoy advanced services such as first-time NFTs, snapping up blind boxes, etc. In the future, ANIMeta will provide users with more ways to play.
###### It has been more than ten years since the birth of blockchain technology. Under the vigorous promotion of different teams, blockchain projects emerge in an endless stream, but their empowering effect on economic life is not well reflected. Blockchain technology is a great revolution, but if a technology cannot be put into practical use and combined with applications in various fields, it is just a castle in the air. If the problem of practical application is not solved, blockchain technology can only be reduced to a testing ground for certain concepts and fields and a paradise for speculators. As a pioneer in the blockchain industry, we have been thinking about how to give full play to the empowering role of blockchain technology in the economy, industry and life.
###### At present, 60% of the world's animation works come from Japan, and the animation industry accounts for more than 10% of Japan's GDP, making it the third largest industry in Japan. At the same time, Japan is also the world's largest exporter of animation industry creations. With the continuous development of technology, the animation industry has also incorporated more fresh blood, such as AR/VR, virtual idols, etc. But at the same time, we can also see that these new technologies have not changed the fundamental attributes of the animation industry, and there are still many bottleneck problems in the entire industry, such as high threshold for realization, lack of creative rights, industry lag, etc. Therefore, we need to introduce the concept of blockchain to solve the problems of the current animation industry with the characteristics of semi-centralization, digitization and standardization.
###### In this context, the project team created the "ANIMETA" semi-centralized NFT trading platform. The platform combines animation industry-related IP, works, peripherals and NFTs to create an open animation NFT token creation and trading ecosystem. ANIMETA believes that every animation work can be connected through NFT, aiming to achieve NFT interoperability across domains and platforms. As the core link connecting the upstream and downstream of the NFT+ Metaverse industry, ANIMETA plays a crucial role in building NFTs, transactions, monetization, and value-added income, and will eventually become the best platform to solve the digital bottleneck of the animation industry.

# common problem
##### 1. What are the key terms that beginners need to know?
###### Below is a list of key terms used in the NFT space, it is helpful to review before you start. Unforgeable Tokens (NFTs) - Unforgeable Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital items with blockchain-governed ownership. Examples of NFTs include digital art, collectibles, virtual reality projects, encrypted domain names, ownership records for physical assets, and more. For further information on NFTs and how we got here, read our overview.
###### ETH ‚Äì Ethereum is a blockchain and ETH is the currency used for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
###### BSC ‚Äì Binance is a blockchain and BNB is the currency used for transactions on the BSC blockchain.
###### HECO ‚Äì Huobi is a blockchain, and HT is the currency used for transactions on the Huobi blockchain.
###### GSA Fees - Think of GAS fees as blockchain transaction costs. ANIMETA has no say in setting gas fees - they are determined by supply/demand across the blockchain network.
###### Wallet Address ‚Äì Your wallet address is unique. It is the address people will use when sending cryptocurrencies or NFTs to your cryptocurrency wallet.
##### 2. How to sell NFTs?
###### Before listing an NFT for sale, our team will first review the content to ensure that it meets the listing standards. The process usually takes 4-8 hours. After the approval, the NFT will be listed on the trading market immediately. You can set it to auction or price sale according to your personal preference. In addition, you can also choose to list NFTs at a fixed time (no earlier than 12 hours after approval).
##### 3. What is a non-fungible token (NFT)?
###### A non-fungible token (NFT) is a cryptographic token that represents a unique asset. They are able to verifiably prove authenticity and ownership in the blockchain network. NFTs are not interchangeable, thus bringing scarcity to the digital world.

# User Guide
##### What is NFT? 
###### The full name of NFT is Non-fungible-token, which is non-fungible Token, which corresponds to FT (Fungible Token). With the support of memory block chain technology, it is used as an on-chain certificate of rights for digital commodities such as digital artworks and event tickets. Each NFT mirrors a unique serial number on a specific memory block chain, which cannot be tampered with, indivisible, or substituted for each other. It is these qualities that make NFTs an excellent carrier of digital artwork, each NFT representing a specific digital artwork or a single replica of its limited release, recording its immutable on-chain rights. Therefore, NFT is essentially different from the virtual currency and other equivalent tokens. It is supported by the actual value of digital commodities, and does not have any attributes such as payment functions. NFT has several major characteristics:
###### 1„ÄÅindivisible. Each NFT is an independent entity and cannot be split, so a part of the NFT cannot be purchased or transferred, so it is indivisible.
###### 2„ÄÅProvable scarcity. The number of NFT minting can be verified through the public memory blockchain network, and the number is fixed, immutable, and provable.
###### 3„ÄÅuniqueness. Each NFT is unique and has different properties, which are usually stored in metadata and cannot be tampered with after minting. It sounds abstract. Let‚Äôs talk about homogenized Tokens first: such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. I have a Bitcoin and exchange it with one of your Bitcoins, it does not affect its value at all, what I have is still a Bitcoin currency. Just like the 100 bucks in my hand and the 100 bucks in your hand are interchangeable. But if I have a concert ticket in my hand, I may not be willing to exchange a concert ticket in your hand, because the position of my ticket and yours must be different. Maybe mine is in the front row. Yours is in the last row, this seat number is clearly written on the ticket, and there is a clear difference between the two tickets. NFTs are similar to concert tickets, each one is unique. Also, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, it can be split into 0.1 or 0.01. NFTs are indivisible. Just like a concert ticket, if you get half of it, you will not be able to enter the venue. So, what is the use of NFT? An NFT is a cryptographic token on a memory blockchain that represents a unique asset. These can be fully digital assets or tokenized versions of real-world assets. Since NFTs are not interchangeable with each other, they can serve as proofs of authenticity and ownership within the digital realm. Fungibility means that the individual units of an asset are interchangeable and essentially indistinguishable from each other. For example, fiat currency is fungible because each unit is interchangeable with any other equivalent single unit. A ten dollar bill is interchangeable with any other real ten dollar bill. This is essential for assets designed to act as a medium of exchange. Fungibility is a desirable property of money because it can be exchanged freely and theoretically, the history of each individual unit cannot be known. However, this is not a beneficial feature for collectibles. What if we could create a digital asset similar to Bitcoin, but add a unique identifier to each unit? This will make each of them distinct from all other units (ie, irreplaceable). Essentially, this is NFT.
##### What can NFTs be used for?
###### We know that the Internet is a world in which information can flow freely. Whether it is text, pictures or videos, information can be instantly transferred to any corner of the world through the Internet. It can be said that the Internet has greatly subverted people's way of life. However, when these texts, pictures, and videos are transferred, the copy is actually transferred, and the original is still stored locally. When a picture has been spread countless times on the Internet, who can tell which is the original and which is the copy? Because NFT has the characteristics of unique identification, the text, pictures and videos loaded with NFT are equivalent to having a unique identification in the digital world. No matter how many copies of this information are copied, the one with the NFT identity is the original. And NFT is based on the underlying technology of the memory block chain, which allows the information with NFT to be freely traded without the need for intermediary giants. The reason why the memory block chain is called the "Internet of Value" is that it complements the last piece of the Internet puzzle and solves the "double-spending problem" of transactions without the need for a third-party intermediary. NFT is currently this "Internet of Value" a shining pearl.
###### So, where exactly are NFTs used? In fact, there are many application scenarios of NFT, such as the NFT digital artworks auctioned by Christie's, the artwork itself is based on memory block chain technology, NFT represents the work itself, the NFT Token is transferred from the seller's wallet to the buyer's wallet, and the buyer completes the payment at the same time. , which means the end of the transaction. Similar NFTs include encrypted game assets (such as the smash hit Encrypted Cat in 2017), encrypted collectibles (NFTs of NBA stars' highlight moments sold by NBA Top Shot), etc., which can be derived from financial derivatives, personal identity in the future. data, etc. Of course, in addition to these native encrypted assets (NFTs developed based on memory blockchain technology), there are also some physical assets that issue NFTs, such as physical works of art, real estate and other physical assets, etc. These NFTs are actually just an online identity certificate for circulation , requires a third-party intermediary with a relatively high degree of credibility in the real world to provide arbitration witnesses to ensure that NFT can correspond to the corresponding physical assets. Another type of existing Internet assets, such as domain names, etc., also requires third-party giant institutions to provide relevant certification materials, so that NFTs correspond to corresponding assets.

# Royalty Description
###### NFT royalties ensure that an artist's work is always fairly rewarded. This article will walk you through the basics and explain how to earn passive income using NFT royalties. If you are an artist and you want to mint your first NFT. You have a lot of things to consider, such as price, royalties, etc. In this article, we will address the issue of "royalties". What are they, how do they work and what should your royalty percentage be? NFTs are an immutable proof of ownership where every transaction is stored and visible on the in-memory blockchain, making it possible to include royalties on every sale between now and the end of time! What are royalties? Each time the intellectual property (IP) is resold, the sales royalties provide the creator of the intellectual property (IP) with a percentage of the sales. While this is difficult to perform outside the NFT space, in-memory blockchains and smart contracts automate the process, making it easier to collect royalties. When you are authoring the NFT, you set the royalty percentage between 10 and 30%. You set it up however you want, and every time you resell, you don't have to do anything to get the royalties from each resale. Thanks to the in-memory blockchain and smart contracts, when your NFTs are resold, all royalties are automatically deposited directly into your wallet. You can't change it once it's set, so make sure you're set! Let's say you're an unknown artist selling your art for $10 each. It's been a while and you're finally famous! All your $10 art is now resold for $10,000! If you set it to 10%, for every $10,000 you resell, you'll get $1,000!
###### How to set your royalty percentage? There are a number of factors to consider when choosing a royalty percentage, which are divided into two scenarios:
###### 1„ÄÅSet a high percentage case Set a higher percentage, if when your NFT is sold, it will give you more money. Good news for you if your NFTs get a lot of resale, which adds up to a very substantial income after a while!
###### 2„ÄÅSetting a Low Percentage Setting a lower royalty percentage, it may be easier to sell the NFT because the buyer will pay less if the NFT is resold. You can try doing some research. Try setting different percentages for each item and see what happens. Which ones sell easily and which ones take some time or don't sell at all? This might give you an idea of what your royalties should be. How you set it up in the end is up to you! Please note that royalties also apply to the first sale (via your sale), and are only collected when ANIMETA makes a sale. For example, if you set the sale price to 100MDX and set a 10% royalty on your collection, you will receive 10MDX in royalty income from the sale.
###### 1. Upload your artwork to create NFT.
###### 2. You as the NFT creator choose a royalty percentage of 10-30%.
###### 3.ANIMETA When someone buys your NFT for the first time, you will get 100% of the sale price.
###### 4.If your NFT is resold at ANIMETA, you will get 10-30% of the resale price.
###### 5.You don't have to do anything to earn royalties, and the earnings are automatically deposited into your wallet.
