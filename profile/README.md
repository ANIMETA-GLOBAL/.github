# Welcome! 👋
###### Welcome your arrival.
###### Welcome to ANIMETA! Here , you will find all the information about what you need to know about ANIMETA! 
# Introduction
## Vision
#### It aims to help more creators launch their NFTs on the blockchain at the lowest price in a fair way.
###### It has been more than ten years since the birth of blockchain technology. With the vigorous promotion of different teams, blockchain projects emerge in an endless stream, but the enabling effect on economic life is not well reflected. Blockchain technology is a great revolution, but if a technology can not be put into practice and combined with applications in various fields, it is only a castle in the air. If we do not solve the problem of practical application, block chain technology will eventually become a testing ground for some concepts and fields and a paradise for speculators. As a pioneer in the blockchain industry, we have been thinking about how to give full play to the enabling role of blockchain technology in the economy, industry and life.
###### At present, 60% of the world's animation works come from Japan, and the animation industry accounts for more than 10% of Japan's GDP, making it the third largest industry in Japan. At the same time, Japan is also the world's largest exporter of animation industry creation. With the continuous development of technology, the animation industry has also incorporated more fresh blood, such as AR/VR, virtual idols and so on. But at the same time, we can also see that these new technologies have not changed the fundamental attributes of the animation industry, and there are still many bottlenecks in the whole industry, such as high liquidity threshold, lack of creative rights, industry lag, etc. These problems are difficult to solve under the traditional technical framework, so we need to introduce them. It is used to solve the problems of the current animation industry with the characteristics of semi-centralization, digitalization and standardization.
###### In this context, the project team created the "ANIMETA" semi-centralized NFT trading platform. The platform combines animation industry-related IP, works, peripherals and NFTs to create an open animation NFT token creation and trading ecosystem. ANIMETA believes that every animation work can be connected through NFT, aiming to achieve NFT interoperability across domains and platforms. As the core link connecting the upstream and downstream of the NFT+ Metaverse industry, ANIMETA plays a crucial role in building NFTs, transactions, monetization, and value-added income, and will eventually become the best platform to solve the digital bottleneck of the animation industry.

# Frequently asked questions（FAQ）
##### 1. What are the key terms to know for beginners? ？
###### The following is a list of key terms used in the NFT space, and it is helpful to review them before you begin. Non-Forgeable Tokens (NFTs). Non-Forgeable Tokens (NFTs) are unique, digital items with blockchain management ownership. Examples of NFTs include digital art, collectibles, virtual reality projects, encrypted domain names, ownership records of physical assets, and more. For further information on NFTs and how we got here, read our overview.
###### ETH – Ethereum is a blockchain, and ETH is the currency used to make transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
###### BSC – Binance is a blockchain and BNB is the currency used for transactions on the BSC blockchain.
###### HECO – Huobin is a blockchain and HT is the currency used for transactions on the Huobin blockchain.
###### GSA fees – Treat the GSA fees as blockchain transaction costs. ANIMETA has no say in setting gas fees , they are determined by the supply/demand of the entire blockchain network.
##### 2. How to sell NFT？
###### To put an NFT on the shelf, our team first reviews the content to make sure it meets the shelf criteria. The process typically takes 4-8 hours. Once approved, the NFT will be immediately available on the trading market. You can set it to auction or sell it at a fixed price according to your personal preference. Alternatively, the NFT may be placed on the shelf at a fixed time (no earlier than 12 hours after approval).
##### 3. What is a non-homogeneous token? (NFT)？
###### A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a cryptographic token that represents a unique asset. They are able to prove authenticity and ownership in the block network in a verifiable manner. NFTs are not interchangeable, creating scarcity in the digital world.
##### 4. How to calculate the transaction fee for buying and selling NFT?
###### You will pay 2% -5% platform fee +% of royalty charged by NFT author (Royalty is set by NFT creator)
##### 5. Can rewards be extracted in real time? ？
###### Yes, the reward obtained by the user can be withdrawn at any time.

# User Guide
##### What is NFT? 
###### The full name of NFT is Non-fungible-Token, which corresponds to FT (Fungible Token). With the support of memory block chain technology, it can be used as the chain right certificate of digital artworks, event tickets and other digital commodities. Each NFT is mapped to a unique serial number on a specific memory block chain, which cannot be tampered with, divided, or replaced. It is these qualities that make NFT an excellent vehicle for digital artworks. Each NFT represents a specific digital artwork or a single copy of it sold in limited quantities, recording its chain rights that cannot be tampered with. Therefore, NFT is essentially different from homogeneous tokens such as virtual currency, which is supported by the actual value of digital goods and does not have any attributes such as payment function. 
###### NFT has several characteristics:
###### 1.Indivisibility. Each NFT is an individual and cannot be split, so it cannot be purchased or transferred as part of the NFT and is therefore indivisible. 
###### 2.Provable scarcity. The number of NFT casting can be verified by the public memory block chain network. The number is fixed, eternal and provable.
###### 3. Uniqueness. Each NFT is unique and has different attributes, which are typically stored in metadata and cannot be tampered with after casting. As abstract as it sounds, let's talk about Homogenization Token first: for example, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. I have a Bitcoin and exchange it with one of your Bitcoins without affecting its value at all. What I have is still a Bitcoin. Just like the 100 yuan in my hand and the 100 yuan in your hand are interchangeable. But if I have a concert ticket in my hand, I may not be willing to exchange it for a concert ticket in your hand, because the position of my ticket is definitely different from that of your ticket. It is possible that my ticket is in the front row and yours is in the last row. The seat number is clearly written on the ticket. There is a clear difference between the two tickets. NFT is similar to concert tickets, each one is unique. Moreover, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, it can be divided into 0.1 or 0.01. NFT is indivisible. Just like a concert ticket, if you get half of it, you can't get in. So what exactly is the NFT good for? NFT is a crypto token on the memory blockchain that represents a unique asset. These can be fully digital assets or tokenized versions of real-world assets. Since NFTs are not interchangeable with each other, they serve as proof of authenticity and ownership within the digital realm. Interchangeability means that the individual units of an asset are interchangeable and essentially indistinguishable from each other. For example, fiat money is interchangeable because each unit is interchangeable with any other equivalent single unit. A ten dollar bill is interchangeable with any other real ten dollar bill. This is essential for assets that are intended to act as a medium of exchange. Interchangeability is a desirable property of money because it allows free exchange and, in theory, there is no way to know the history of each individual unit. However, this is not a beneficial characteristic for collectibles. What if we could create digital assets similar to Bitcoin, but instead add a unique identifier to each unit? This would make each of them different from all other units (i.e., irreplaceable). In essence, this is NFT.
##### What can NFTs be used for?
###### We know that the Internet is a world where information can flow freely. Whether it is text, pictures or videos, information can be instantly transferred to any corner of the world through the Internet. It can be said that the Internet has greatly subverted people's way of life. However, when these words, pictures and videos are transferred, they are actually copies, and the originals are still kept locally. When a picture has been spread countless times by the Internet, who can tell which is the original and which is the copy? Because NFT has the characteristics of unique identification, the text, pictures and videos loaded with NFT are equivalent to a unique identification in the digital world. No matter how many copies of this information are made, the one bearing the NFT identity is the original. Moreover, NFT is based on the underlying technology of memory block chain, which allows information with NFT to be traded freely without the need for intermediary giants. The reason why the memory blockchain is called the "Internet of Value" is that it complements the last piece of the puzzle of the Internet and solves the "double flower problem" of transactions without the need for third-party intermediaries. NFT is currently a shining pearl on this "Internet of Value". 
###### So where exactly is NFT used? In fact, there are many application scenarios of NFT, such as the NFT digital artwork auctioned by Christie's. The artwork itself is based on memory block chain technology. NFT represents the work itself. The Token of NFT is transferred from the seller's wallet to the buyer's wallet. At the same time, the buyer completes the payment, which means the end of the transaction. Similar NFTs include encrypted game assets (such as the popular encrypted cat in 2017), encrypted collections (the highlight video NFT of NBA stars sold by NBA Top Shot), which can be derived into financial derivatives, personal identity data and other fields in the future. Of course, in addition to these native encrypted assets (NFT developed based on memory block chain technology), there are also some physical assets issuing NFT, such as physical art works, real estate and other physical assets, which are actually only an online transfer identity certificate, requiring a relatively high degree of credibility in the real world. Ensure that the NFT is mapped to the appropriate physical asset. Another kind of existing Internet assets, such as domain names, also require third-party giant organizations to provide relevant authentication information, so that NFT corresponds to the corresponding assets.

## A description of the royalties
###### NFT royalties ensure that artists are always fairly rewarded for their work. This article takes you through the basics and explains how to earn passive income using NFT royalties. If you are an artist, you want to cast your first NFT. You have many things to consider, such as price, royalties, and so on. In this article, we will address the issue of "royalties.". What are they, how do they work, and what should your royalty percentage be? NFT is a tamper-proof proof of ownership where every transaction is stored and visible on the memory blockchain, making it possible to include royalties on every sale between now and the end of time! What is royalty? ？ Each time an intellectual property (IP) is resold, a sales royalty provides the creator of the IP with a percentage of the sale. While this is difficult to perform outside of the NFT space, in-memory blockchains and smart contracts automate the process, making it easier to collect royalties. When you are authoring an NFT, you set the royalty percentage to 0 to 10%. You set it up as you wish, and each time you resell, you don't need to do anything else to get royalties from each resale. Thanks to the in-memory blockchain and smart contracts, all royalties are automatically deposited directly into your platform ID when your NFT is resold. You can't change it once it's set, so make sure you set it! Suppose you are an unknown artist with every piece. Sell your art for $10. Some time has passed, and you are finally famous! All of you $10 Art Now Resales for $10,000! If you set the royalty to 0%, then you will get no royalty proceeds, but if you set it to 10%, you will get $1000 for every $10000 resold!
###### How to set your royalty percentage? There are many factors to consider when choosing a royalty percentage, and there are two scenarios: 
###### 1. Set a higher percentage. If your NFT is sold, it will give you more profit. This is great news for you if your NFT is getting a lot of resales, adding up to a very substantial income after a while! 
###### 2. Set a low percentage. It may be easier to sell the NFT by setting a lower royalty percentage because the buyer will pay less if the NFT is resold. You can try to do some research. Try setting different percentages for each item and see what happens. Which ones sell easily, which ones take some time or don't sell at all? This may give you an idea of what your royalties should be. In the end, how to set it up is up to you! Your attention, please ? Royalties also apply to the first sale (via your sale). Royalties are only collected when ANIMETA makes the sale. For example, if you set the sale price to 100 MDX and set a 10% royalty in the collection library, you will get 10 MDX of the royalty proceeds from the sale.
###### 1. Upload your artwork to create NFT。
###### 2. As you NFT creators choose a royalty percentage of 0-10%.
###### 3. ANIMETA The first time someone buys your NFT, you will receive 100% of the sale price.
###### 4. If your NFT is resold at ANIMETA and you will receive 0-10% of the resale price. 
###### 5. You don't have to do anything to get royalties. Proceeds are automatically deposited directly into your wallet.
